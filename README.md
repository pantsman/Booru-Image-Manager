# Booru Image Manager

An attempt a a simple management script for various pictures acrued on the internet. This is pretty much a personal project and don't expect to see it get a lot of use.
Currently the site queries only utilize Danbooru but the plan is to incorporate other sites once I get core functionality down. Working functions are as follows

1. Loading/Refreshing Fodlers
2. Downloading
3. THAT'S IT!

The other menu options call nothing I'll fix that at some point
