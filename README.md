# Booru Image Manager

An attempt a a simple management script for various pictures acrued on the internet. This is pretty much a personal project and don't expect to see it get a lot of use.
Currently supports the following sites:

- Danbooru
- Konachan .com/.net
- Yandere
- Sakugabooru

Here's what the script currently does:
1. Downloading
2. THAT'S IT!

I had other plans for additional functionality but rolled that back till I had at least one function working well :sob: will also probably be renamed at some point :neutral_face:
